Exercise 2

 The goal of the exercise is to use scala collections in order to perform various tasks.

 We have a list of people:

 val people = List( ("John", "Doe", 23, "male"), ("Joan", "Doe", 23, "female"), ("Steve", "Jenkins", 24, "male"), ("Eva", "Robinson", 25, "female"),

 ("Ben", "Who", 22, "male"), ("Janet", "Reed", 21, "female"), ("Rob", "Jenkins", 26, "male"), ("Ella", "Dawson", 27, "female") )

 The meaning of fields is obvious.


 Using collections API (simple for loop solutions are excluded) print the following information.

 - Print list of females and list of males.

 - Obtain names of all people of age above 23.

 - Check if among the people on the list there is someone of name Joe and John.

 - Check if everyone is older than 20.

 - Obtain a list of First names and age.

 - Group all people by age.

 - Split the list of people into younger and older than 23.

 - Find the oldest and youngest.

 - In a single set of transformations check if the number of males and females in the list is identical.

 - Obtain a sorted list of people of age above 23 with dropWhile and sort.
